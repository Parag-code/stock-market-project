## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an advanced **Deep Learning–based Stock Forecasting System** that predicts future stock prices and provides **AI-driven trading recommendations**.

The model leverages **historical market data**, **technical indicators**, and **LSTM neural networks** to generate accurate predictions and actionable insights:

- 📈 Predicts **future stock prices** for the next 5 days  
- 🔮 Classifies **market trend** (UP or DOWN)  
- 💹 Generates **trading signals**: BUY ✅, HOLD ⏸️, or SELL ❌  

It’s designed for analysts, investors, and developers who want a smart AI tool for financial forecasting and automated trading decisions.
